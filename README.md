# Mapping_Earthquakes

In the "Earthquake_Challenge" folder, please find an index.html file and a folder titled "Static" with two folders within it, "js" and "css." In the "js" folder is the "challenge_logic.js" file, and in the "css" folder, the "style.css" file. This Module 13 Challenge required me to add the tectonic plate data, major earthquake data, and create an additional map.
